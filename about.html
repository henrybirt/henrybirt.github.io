      <p>The 21 year old singer-songwriter Henry Birt, is no stranger to the Bristol music scene. After being a drummer in bands throughout his teens and picking up the guitar and piano alongside this, Birt's individuality comes from the fact that all his tracks are recorded by himself alone. Inspired by the likes of Lenny Kravitz and Paul McCartney.</p><br>
      <p>Pulsating drum beats, paired with catchy riffs and powerful vocals encapsulate Henry's sound. Taking cues from Blossoms and Inhaler but with the heavy drive of Lenny Kravitz guitar, and resembling similarities to The Verve's Richard Ashcroft in vocal tonality, keep an eye out for Birt's latest releases and his band live.</p><br>
